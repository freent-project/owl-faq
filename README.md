# OpenWindows License FAQ

This document answers common questions to the OpenWindows license.

## Can I use the OpenWindows license?

Yes. Our goal is to promote free and open-source software. We license most of our software
under the OpenWindows license. You can, too ;)

## Does the OpenWindows license permit patents?

It depends. The OWL tries to restrict patents to a level that would be acceptable by
free software developers.

## Why does the OpenWindows license look like a deed?

The OpenWindows developers could not write a long version because we're only good
at writing short paragraphs.

The OpenWindows License, version 2.0, will be published in September 2025, and deployed
to FreeNT and OpenWindows software in January 2026.

## I'm making a video, a sound effect, music, an image, etc. Can I use the OpenWindows license?

Yes, but you shouldn't.
The OpenWindows License is not meant for media and therefore you should not use it for such
types of content. The OWL is meant for software.

## Can I modify the OpenWindows license?

You can modify the OpenWindows license in a minor way, or translate it into another language
(which we already do in license-translations).

However, we discourage modifying the OpenWindows license, which is why the document includes
this notice:

> Everyone is permitted to distribute verbatim copies of this docuent, but changing it is not allowed.

We suggest you add additional notes if you want to add exceptions or extra conditions to the
OpenWindows License. You can put such notices in a comment in your code.

## Is the OpenWindows license suitable for proprietary software?

No. The OWL contains permissions that defy the purpose of proprietary software. This makes the
license incompatible with proprietary software.

If you use the OWL on your proprietary software, it will have no effect, and will not do anything
to protect your work. It will increase the risk of piracy.
